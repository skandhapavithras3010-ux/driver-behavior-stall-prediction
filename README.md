# 🚗 AI-Powered Driver Behaviour & Stall Prediction System

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts vehicle stall risk from synthetic driving telemetry using **XGBoost**. The project combines **feature engineering**, **explainable AI (SHAP)**, and **driver behaviour profiling (K-Means)** to identify high-risk driving conditions and analyse driving patterns.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Generated a **150,000-row synthetic vehicle telemetry dataset** across 50 drivers and 500 driving sessions.
- Engineered **14 mechanical and behavioural features**, including rolling statistics and interaction features.
- Trained an **XGBoost multiclass classifier** for stall risk prediction.
- Applied **SHAP Explainability** to identify the most influential features affecting model predictions.
- Performed **K-Means clustering** to group drivers into four behavioural profiles based on driving characteristics.
- Produced visual reports for model explainability and driver profiling.
